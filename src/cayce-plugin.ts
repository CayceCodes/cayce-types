/**
 * This class defines the interface for a Cayce plugin. Currently, this supports two types of information:
 *
 * 1. The package name of the plugin - This is provided by us - Cayce maintainers - and is used to surface
 * the plugin's package name to the Cayce CLI and Engine. It uses the package.json file of the plugin and
 * reads the name field to get the package name. *** Note: Developers creating plugins do not need to implement
 * this function, as the abstract class below contains the method used to grab the package name.
 *
 * 2. The rules that the plugin provides - This is provided by the plugin developer and is used to surface the rules.
 * The rules are defined in the plugin and are returned by the getRules method. As a reminder, the CLI is responsible
 * for filtering included rules.
 *
 * Here's how you can implement this class:
 * ```TypeScript
 * export default class MyRules extends CayceBasePlugin implements CaycePlugin {
 *     getRules(): ScanRule[] {
 *         (...) // Your rules here
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Notes:
 *  1. You must export your class as default for the plugin loader to work.
 *  2. Your package must be configured to generate an ESM module.
 *
