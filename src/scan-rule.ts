/**
 * Annotation Reference
 *
 * @see `message(string)`
 * A message to be displayed to the user that gives information about the result of applying a rule. This is the "what" and "why" in the conversation
 *
 * @see `name(string)`
 * A human-readable name for the rule that gives a general sense as to its nature
 *
 * @see `category(string)`
 * A free-text category that can be leveraged for reporting and organization
 *
 * @see `query(string)`
 * The tree sitter query that is initially kicked off to find the nodes of interest. The results can be further modified via the preFilter method
 *
 * @see `regex(string)`
 * A string representation of a simple regular expression that is executed along with an associated ts query. This is the preferred method of using regex in the framework at this time. It requires no extra work on the part of the scripting engine.
 *
 * @see `suggestion(string)`
 * This is the "how" in the conversation with the user. For example, if a violation is found, how does one go about fixing it, communicating tech debt, or justifying an exception that must be made for it. Provides a call to action for the user.
 *
 * @see `priority(number)`
 * This corresponds to the numeric value from the ResultType enum in the ScanResult.ts file. The higher the number, the more important the result is. 0-2 are already "named" in the enum for convenience. To the library, a 2 (RuleType.ERROR) and a 3 are the same thing. Values over 2 have their importance judged by the caretakers of the ruleset.
 *
 * @see `context(string)`
 * Whether this rule is used to scan for violations and areas for improvement or measuring the quantity of node types for various reporting purposes. It also supports both via commas: scan,measure is the same as measure, scan.
 *
